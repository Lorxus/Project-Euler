# Project-Euler
A repository for my Project Euler solutions.
Pretty much all of them will be in Python. Sometimes Colab is my IDE and that's OK; that's why a lot of them are notebooks.
This is more to learn and improve my coding than it is to learn and improve my math, so a lot of the answers here will be hackish or mathematically uninteresting, or even just be limited by my ability to express my math with Python.
